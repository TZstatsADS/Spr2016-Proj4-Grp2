##### Data Analysis
Term: Spring 2016

In this project, we will explore relational data where the data were collected to have information on a set of individuals and on their relations. Part of the big data hype has been fueled by the availability of the huge amount of online human generated information on social networks, individual rating/preferences on products, opinions and views shared via social media (such as facebook, twitter, etc). Topics in this area include

- Collective filtering
- Clustering/community detection
- Network analysis
- Identity resolution


#####Shiny App
The shiny app is a demo presentation for a product of recommendation system. The data is based on the amazon database collected by Stanford University. http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html.
In terms of the nature and the structure of the dataset itself, the duplication of the data is inevitable. The general problem is that different publised verison of the same movie is categorized as different products while they share the same reviews. On the other hand, we do not have any labels for help distinguishing the same products, the efficiency of data-cleaning and the accuracy of the result will be affected.
